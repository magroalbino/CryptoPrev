# CryptoPrev by Firebase Studio

This is a Next.js web application built with Firebase Studio.

## Running the Application

This is a web application built with Next.js. You don't "compile" it like a desktop app; instead, you run it on a local server for development or build it for production hosting.

### Development Mode

To run the app in development mode, which enables features like hot-reloading (the site updates automatically when you change the code), run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, usually available at `http://localhost:9002`.

### Production Mode

To simulate a production environment or to build the app for deployment, follow these two steps:

1.  **Build the application:** This command creates an optimized, production-ready version of your site.

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Start the production server:** This command runs the optimized version you just built.

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

This will start a server with the production build, which you can also access locally.
